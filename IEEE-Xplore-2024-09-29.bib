  abstract={Artificial intelligence and the banking industry complement one other well. Working in an industry where practically every participant adheres to a logic that tries to maximize profits, it is challenging to resist the norm of using speedy calculations, extensive data processing, and precise estimates. Due to the strict mathematical limits placed on making financial assessments, the question of why financial markets still require human interaction arises frequently and the answer to it is for making financial decisions, which are governed by these mathematical limits and to overcome it the use of artificial intelligence (AI) has been necessary and also acts as remedy in both computational and other types of errors in finance sector. Thus from that time AI is used in financial industries. The introduction of digital technology has its own pros and cons. Financial organizations, such as insurers, are either investing billions of dollars to buy data from other industries or developing their own AI capabilities to support the growth of their businesses. Business models based on AI have recently grown, and this trend is expected to continue. In some financial industries, artificial intelligence is unavoidable. It is global in scope.},

  abstract={Effective digital transformation requires new technology to work in harmony with the people towards a common goal. All the universities do not have the same capabilities currently across these three parameters and may not be able, or willing, to develop them in the same way. Therefore, several alternative models conducive to digital transformation and AI adoption must be identified. A university must not have to go on this journey without a roadmap. There should be several education business models that optimize AI adoption to choose from. Identifying the destination in advance reinforces the trust between the digital transformation leader and the followers. This research identifies four education business models that are optimized for AI. The first is focus and disaggregate. The second is to keep the existing model but enhance it with AI. The third is an educator expanding beyond their current model and the fourth is a disruptor entering education.},

  abstract={New data-driven business models have emerged as a direct consequence of the continuous ‘datafication’ of our social reality. Correspondingly, the market for educational services is growing rapidly. There has been a dramatic shift in the education sector as a result of the proliferation of educational technology (EdTech) businesses, delivering data-driven pedagogical solutions. Despite the present state of the industry, there are still only a small number of businesses that fully use the potential of AI and LA to provide personalized educational experiences. The primary emphasis of this study is on the motivations and challenges presently influencing data-based pedagogical and curricular pathways within the context of EdTech firms. The discourse analysis shows that the conventional educational goal and the novel notion of teaching and sharing knowledge are at polar opposites. A lack of data comprehension, ambiguity, and a lack of data sovereignty hinders the creation and execution of relevant solutions, however, simultaneously the demand for adaptation and customization drives the discourse around AI-based learning systems.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a popular buzzword in discourse. Programs, algorithms, systems, or robots that exhibit AI are referred as as intelligence. In a broader sense, it refers to a group of instruments that can increase a product's or service's intelligence or remedy. AI is having a significant impact on the retail industry. The purpose of this essay is to provide a conceptual framework for understanding artificial intelligence. Describes the use of artificial intelligence in several aspects of commerce and discusses the potential applications of AI in retail, concluding with a broad recommendation for future AI research. The popularity of artificial intelligence can be attributed to a variety of valid reasons. Take the following example into consideration. In order to set up future automatic bill payments, you must transfer funds from your savings account to your checking account at your retail bank. If you were dealing with conventional retail banking, you would have needed to go to the nearest branch and make a cash transfer. Human or automated teller machines would be used for this purpose. Mobile banking allows you to make transfers by simply logging into your device and selecting the appropriate button. What if your wearable device or smartphone could tell you what to do? To complete this transaction? During this process, you should seek advice from a professional. What are the best methods for managing your finances and making wise financial decisions? Erica is a voice-activated artificial intelligence-based virtual financial assistant available through Bank of America's mobile app. Additionally, Erica quick completion of the desired transaction, it also provides advice on a variety of financial matters, such as the capacity to reduce mortgage payments by adhering to option for refinancing, warning clients of suspicious activities in their accounts, displaying their most recent credit score as a result, and providing suggestions to improve it.Retail has seen the arrival of AI! Consumers' everyday routines and retail transactions are being influenced by it. Retail data continue to soar, with corporate data doubling every 1.2 years. Purchase information, online browsing information, and data from social media, mobile device activity, and client data on satisfaction. For instance, a merchant like Walmart has around one million exchanges per hour, adding 2.5 terabytes of information to the total. AI programs in retail are suitable for training on massive datasets. The development and usage of AI. Utilizing these expanding data, retailers are putting money into various AI applications. I estimate that shops will invest $6 billion on AI by 2022. AI has an effect on both the supply and demand sides. On AI is assisting retailers to better comprehend the demand side and anticipate consumer wants, as well as make the best choices to increase a customer's lifetime value. Regarding supply on the plus side, AI is making supply networks more effective. and enhance logistics and inventory control. AI is helping consumers and shoppers make decisions, their interaction with shops will change.},

  abstract={The previous few years have witnessed significant shifts in people's aspirations and lives as a result of technology improvements. When discussing the advancements in technology over the past twenty years, we must first discuss the pre-Internet era before moving on to the Internet era.After that, systems that are service-oriented replaced those of the Internet age. After then, we entered the era of social applications and left behind service-oriented systems. The social application era was eventually superseded by the age of artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.The theory, subsequent development, and integration of intelligent behavior akin to that of humans in machines is known as artificial intelligence, or AI. A branch of AI called machine learning has important uses in many different fields of technology.In recent years, there has been a substantial advancement in the business model framework for artificial intelligence and machine learning. Nonetheless, there is one area that needs more investigation and understanding even though it is crucial for academics, policymakers, and aspiring managers to know: how companies are evolving their AI business model frameworks to achieve ongoing value creation.Research and experience on AI business model frameworks have consequences for machine learning (ML) in this investigation. In order to create and adapt their company model and maintain value generation, executives can use this tool to reproduce and categorize significant difficulties. We want to investigate the theoretical underpinnings of the Business Model Framework in this study, which uses Consumer Business Analytics to transform the business market ecology.},

  abstract={In general, the data-centric revolution is rejoicing over the widespread use of Artificial intelligence (AI) and business analytics to use the potential and success of firms fully. Nevertheless, there are few studies investigating the impact of AI integrated business analytics (AI-BA's) unforeseen effects on a company's competitive advantage. Amidst this context, this research aims to determine how elements like opacity of AI - BA, perceived risk and sub-optimal business choices cause operational inefficiencies and competitive disadvantages. The suggested study model incorporates the perspective based on resources, the dynamic capability viewpoint, and the theory of contingencies to understand how an opacity of AI-BA impacts a negative performance and firm's risk environment. The sample size (mid-level, operational, and senior) representing different service industries and company sizes in India. According to the findings, AI-BA opacity was caused by ineffective training of key personnel, poor quality data, and a lack of governance. Consequently, operational inefficiencies set in, and businesses make less-than-ideal choices due to increased perceived risk. According to the research, a company's operational inefficiency puts it at a competitive disadvantage due to negative growth in sales and dissatisfied personnel. The results also show that contingency plans have a significant moderating influence on the nomological chain.},

  abstract={The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed with time, and with the advent of Big Data, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Neural Networks, the fundamentals of AI and the way it is perceived in today’s life have undergone a sea-change. However, along with this, the perception of Data and Security has also come a long way. Security earlier meant being in a secure, safe, risk-free zone; it has now metamorphosed itself into a concept of perimeter-driven layers of security – which changes from person to person. Against this backdrop, some of the pertinent questions that face us today are: Does AI aim to replace Human Intelligence? Would AI overtake Human Intelligence? Can AI ‘learn’ on its own – thereby teaching itself new concepts and mechanisms – while on the fly? This article takes us through the various concepts of AI, its types and modes of growth and expected future development, leading to its impact on society, businesses, culture and people. Further, this study leads to impact points of AI development and progress on points like data and security and possible costs of security and whether they would be restricted to financial costs alone. Towards the end, the authors put forth thoughts to ponder on whether Big Data and AI are the answers to all questions that lie ahead; and how AI can play a role in the betterment of Data and Security available to global citizens of future societies; with a responsible impact on businesses, economies, people and culture.},

  abstract={The paper examines how the development of digital technologies, in particular artificial intelligence (AI), affects the labor market and changes the work process. It is argued that the main goal of enterprise management in the conditions of digital transformations is the formation of internal motivation among employees. As a result of this, the employee's dependence on positive and negative reinforcements from management decreases and self-motivation increases. The internal and external factors that contribute to the increase or decrease of the salary are determined. The role of the obtained results in further practical implementation is to make clear how AI algorithms help employees reach goals more efficiently - based on the study of cases of digitalization achievements in the field of motivation on the example of Ukrainian innovative companies the construction of the “needs - interests - incentives (motives) - result” scheme was proposed. Direct economic, indirect economic and non-monetary methods of motivation are considered and the main principles of the development of the motivation system are highlighted. It is emphasized that due to the training and retraining of personnel in such a way that the growth of their wages does not lag behind their productivity, and they receive wider opportunities for career growth, it is possible to ensure the sustainability of personnel policy in the conditions of the transformational impact of digitalization and AI.},

We can see how AI is disrupting the business of various sectors in practice. The insurance sector is also being disrupted by the advent of AI. In this paper, we will describe a traditional insurance process, with a look at the specific innovations that AI is introducing in the insurance industry itself and see how it is possible to use AI in local insurance company. Although insurance fraud is the most common form of use of artificial intelligence, this paper will emphasize that artificial intelligence can automatically analyze large amounts of data, identify patterns, and make quick decisions, which can lead to optimization of business processes and cost reduction. The insurance industry is going through similar problems as other industries, but it has its own specifics since insurance is a highly regulated area by regulatory agencies and business outside the framework of the home countries. In this paper we will emphasize the fact that we need new skills, especially for using specialized AI tools in the desire to transform any business model. We will use the case of the insurance company from Bosnia and Herzegovina.},

  abstract={Amidst recent supply chain disruptions triggered by pandemics and crises, the imperative of bolstering supply chain security and resilience is escalating. Central to this endeavor is the augmentation of risk-taking capabilities among enterprises at supply chain nodes. Rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI), coupled with the burgeoning concentration within supply chains present promising avenues for enhancing corporate risk-taking capacity (CRTC). However, a conspicuous gap exists in the relationship between enterprise AI transformation, supply chain concentration, and CRTC. This study constructs a panel simultaneous equation model to contrast the direct impact of corporate AI transformation on CRTC with its indirect influence, facilitated by the reduction of supply chain concentration (Scii). The results indicate that the overall effect of corporate AI transformation on CRTC is positive. In the indirect path, an increase in supply chain concentration effectively enhances CRTC, and firms exhibiting higher CRTC also show a preference for supply chains with centralized configurations. All of these interactions involve heterogeneity in property rights and firm life cycle stages. This study broadens the understanding of factors influencing CRTC at the supply chain level and sheds light on the policy implications of enterprise AI transformation. It offers valuable insights for corporates in shaping their risk management strategies and contributes to the discourse on the advancement of emerging technologies and supply chain practices.},

  abstract={Artificial intelligence has not only the potential to influence services and products but also change the existing innovation process itself. While AI creates economic and technological disruption within firms’ competitiveness by serving as a General Purpose Technology (GPT), the focus of the previous literature has been made to the impact on AI on macro economy and employment substitution. To fill this gap, this paper investigates the relationship between the adoption of AI technologies and firm performance such as firm value, profit and cost structures. We identified 105 listed firms in the U.S. that have adopted AI technologies from 2008 to 2014, and tested the relationship using Difference-in-differences (DID). Our empirical findings indicate strong evidence for the positive relationship between AI and firm value. In addition, we find that automation AI has significant and positive impacts on the firm’s cost structure, while we do not find evidence of the effect of augmentation AI on the firm’s profit and cost structures. Finally, we discuss implication of AI adoption by firms for academic literature and firm strategy for AI technologies.},

  abstract={In today's rising consumer awareness, companies are paying more and more attention to customer satisfaction. In order to survive in a fiercely competitive environment and maintain their competitive advantages, the only way to continuously provide consumers with high-quality services is the key to the sustainable operation of modern enterprises. The purpose of this research is focusing on the impact of service quality for automotive aftermarket parts and customers' willingness to repurchase. In this study, 400 questionnaire invitations through e-mail were distributed to existing customers and 164 valid questionnaires were responded. The responded answers were encoded, filed, and verified using SPSS. Degree and validity analysis, narrative statistics, single factor analysis of variance (ANOVA), regression analysis and structural equation modeling were applied for analysis. Through empirical analysis, there are many findings: Sales Service & Marketing, R&D capabilities, and innovative services in service quality are positively and significantly related to customers' willingness to repurchase. In the single factor variation analysis and structural equations, it is found that the impact of customer type on service quality and customer repurchase intention is not significantly related. In this study, Artificial Intelligence (AI) was also applied to compare the impact of service quality and to build the prediction model for customer repurchasing. These AI techniques include decision tree, neural network models, and multiple-linear regression. It is concluded that Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) have better predictive ability after training with sufficient data and proper input data. For decision tree and regression analysis, these models' predicting power will decrease when the data becomes more complex.},

  abstract={Cyber security is a critical problem that causes data breaches, identity theft, and harm to millions of people and businesses. As technology evolves, new security threats emerge as a result of a dearth of cyber security specialists equipped with up-to-date information. It is hard for security firms to prevent cyber-attacks without the cooperation of senior professionals. However, by depending on artificial intelligence to combat cyber-attacks, the strain on specialists can be lessened. as the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) can improve Machine Learning (ML) approaches that can mine data to detect the sources of cyberattacks or perhaps prevent them as an AI method, it enables and facilitates malware detection by utilizing data from prior cyber-attacks in a variety of methods, including behavior analysis, risk assessment, bot blocking, endpoint protection, and security task automation. However, deploying AI may present new threats, therefore cyber security experts must establish a balance between risk and benefit. While AI models can aid cybersecurity experts in making decisions and forming conclusions, they will never be able to make all cybersecurity decisions and judgments.},

  abstract={The need for preparing for digital transformation is a recurrent theme in the recent public and academic debate. Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to reduce operational costs, increase efficiency, and improve customer experience. Thus, it is crucial to forming project teams in an organization, in such a way that they will welcome AI in the decision-making process. The current technological revolution is demanding a rapid pace of change to companies and has increased the attention to the role of teams in fostering innovation adoption. We propose an innovative multicriteria model based on the goal programming approach for solving the optimal allocation of individuals to different groups. The model copes with human resources’ cost and human–machine trust. Indeed, we propose an aggregated measure of the attitude towards AI tools to be employed to support tasks in an organization: more precisely our index is based on three dimensions: technology acceptance, technology self-efficacy, and source credibility. By incorporating this index in a team formation model, each team can be guaranteed to have less resistance to change in adopting machine-based decisions, a scenario that will characterize the years to come. The proposed index can also be integrated into more complex and comprehensive models to support business transformation.},

  abstract={Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) is a state-of-the-art machine learning model capable of generating human-like text through natural language processing (NLP). GPT is trained on massive amounts of text data and uses deep learning techniques to learn patterns and relationships within the data, enabling it to generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. This position paper proposes using GPT technology to generate new process models when/if needed. We introduce ProcessGPT as a new technology that has the potential to enhance decision-making in data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. ProcessGPT can be designed by training a generative pre-trained transformer model on a large dataset of business process data. This model can then be fine-tuned on specific process domains and trained to generate process flows and make decisions based on context and user input. The model can be integrated with NLP and machine learning techniques to provide insights and recommendations for process improvement. Furthermore, the model can automate repetitive tasks and improve process efficiency while enabling knowledge workers to communicate analysis findings, support evidence, and make decisions. ProcessGPT can revolutionize business process management (BPM) by offering a powerful tool for process automation and improvement. Finally, we demonstrate how ProcessGPT can be a powerful tool for augmenting data engineers in maintaining data ecosystem processes within large bank organizations. Our scenario highlights the potential of this approach to improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance the quality of business operations through the automation of data-centric and knowledge-intensive processes. These results underscore the promise of ProcessGPT as a transformative technology for organizations looking to improve their process workflows.},

  abstract={The significant effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on human resource management (HRM) and its revolutionary effect on modern corporate practices have been investigated in this empirical study. In the ever-changing business landscape of today, companies are always looking for innovative strategies to improve productivity and competitiveness. Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a key invention that not only penetrates many industries but also transforms human resource management (HRM) by transforming workforce management, performance evaluation, including talent acquisition. The conventional resume screening process has been changed by AI's involvement in talent acquisition, resulting in it being more objective and efficient. Artificial intelligence (AI)-powered algorithms quickly evaluate a large number of resumes, classify applicants, and identify the best ones. AI gives businesses a competitive edge by broadening the talent pool and scanning a variety of sources to help with proactive candidate sourcing. In order to enhance the applicant experience overall, chatbots and virtual assistants communicate with candidates in real time while they do pre-screening interviews. In order to overcome bias issues, predictive analytics assists in assessing individuals' potential and synchronizes recruiting with strategic goals. Artificial intelligence (AI) brings continuous in addition to objective feedback systems to performance evaluation and feedback, minimizing subjectivity and enhancing fairness. Identifying skill gaps makes individualized development strategies possible. AI's data-driven approach to workforce management including optimization helps with staffing requirements predictions, schedule optimization, resource allocation, and proactive employee attrition management. The use of AI in HRM has many advantages, but it also presents difficulties in addition to moral questions, including data privacy, job security, and decision-making responsibility. To overcome these obstacles, organizations are required to set up strong data protection procedures, open lines of communication, as well as distinct accountability structures. This empirical research explores the complex relationship between AI and HRM and provides guidance with regard to how to use AI to support more ethical and effective HR procedures, which will eventually influence corporate practices in the future.},

  abstract={It is a well-established fact that every organization is established with a certain purpose and goals. Virtually all business organizations regularly obtain measurements dealing with end results but what is reflected on the balance sheet does not necessarily show the true worth of organizations and do not ensure their survival. Thus, the question arises: what exactly makes the organizations sustainable and successful in an ever changing environment? There are several examples of companies like Faber-Castell (1761), Bank of Ireland (1783), Chivas (1802), DuPont (1802) and many more which have been able to sustain and survive over the years and still have a successful existence in the present era. Thus, it is important for the organization to pay equal attention to its three bottom lines, i.e., people, profit and planet for its sustainability, which not only meet the needs of the present generation but should have a futuristic approach as well. At the present time, there is a new normal working dynamic adopted by maximum organizations coping with the pandemic situations to sustain the business environment. Technology is playing a major role in this new working dynamic where machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) is facilitating human functioning at work in an effective manner. The aim of the book is to contribute to the understanding and development of sustainable human resource management processes and practices having recent technologies in alignment. It covers the interconnection among three bottom line sustainable approaches for the growth and development of the organization. Topics discussed in this book include: &#x2022; Disruptive technologies and HR sustainability &#x2022; Convergence of artificial intelligence, HR and organizational growth &#x2022; Triple bottom line sustainability for HRM &#x2022; Business oriented talent analytics &#x2022; Role of leadership in sustainable HRM practices.},

  abstract={The purpose of this study was to investigate the factors that influence the adoption of AI-based predictive analysis in professional audits and to highlight the role of control risk in the decision-making process. The research methodology used was an online survey that targeted accountants and auditors working in audit firms and was distributed using Facebook ads. The findings indicated that control risk mediates the relationship between technological variables and the adoption of AI-based predictive analysis. The study also identified preparedness for IT challenges as the primary driver for adoption, but other factors played a significant role as well. The originality of this study lies in its integration of audit quality, preparedness for IT challenges, and control risk into the TOE model within the technological context. Furthermore, the study proposes control risk as a mediating variable in the study model in the context of the audit profession. The research limitations of this study include the non-random distribution of data among respondents due to the targeting tools used in the survey. The implications of this limitation are that the study's findings may not be generalizable to a wider population of accountants and auditors. Additionally, the study does not consider the impact of cultural and institutional factors that may affect the adoption of AI-based predictive analysis in professional audits. Future research is recommended, considering these factors, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the adoption of AI-based predictive analysis in professional audits.},

  abstract={This study questions the role of willingness to continue collecting additional evidence in the relationship between technological factors and AI-based data analytics adoption in audit firms. Using snowball sampling, 213 valid responses were collected and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). In the context of the TOE framework, the results showed that the willingness to continue collecting more evidence was a key link between the technological factors and the adoption of AI-based data analytics. Willingness to continue collecting additional evidence partially mediated the impacts of clients' AIS complexity, technology integration, and compatibility on AI-based data analytics adoption. Furthermore, the findings demonstrated the impact of a willingness to continue gathering additional evidence on the adoption of AI-based data analytics. The results contribute to the TOE framework by questioning the concept of intention as a mediating variable among the TOE components as a result of the successful use of the willingness to continue collecting additional evidence as a proxy for intention. The "willingness to continue" variable should be used as a stand-in for "intention" in the framework for future research. This is especially important because "intention" is something that should be at the level of individuals, not firms.},

Employee commitment and the use of expert systems (AI) not only assist employees automate regular tasks and increase productivity, but also make them happier by improving engagement. So, it is proposed and advised that using collaboration tools and AI (artificial intelligence) might increase employee engagement because these technologies make work easier. With today's technology, employees may work efficiently, with more freedom, and within the allotted time.},

  abstract={In this study, the heterogeneous integration of three mixed test chips is investigated and designed for AI hardware. An high bandwidth memory (HBM) test die, a die with a 75 and 55 μm mixed micro-bump solder joint pitch, and a smaller die at 150 $\mu \mathbf{m}$ solder joint pitch are all joined onto an organic substrate with 2 $\mu \mathbf{m}$ /2 μm line and space to achieve high-bandwidth interconnections. The organic substrate in this study is a 35 mm x 35 mm square with 4+1 5-2-5 layers and ENEPIG (electroless Ni/Pd/Au) surface finished pads. To enable the joints for mixed pitches across the substrate, both belt furnace reflow and thermo-compression bonding (TCB) processes were investigated. Additionally, the chip-side interconnection with varied copper content was also simultaneously investigated to fully optimize the chip join process. The joint quality was verified with cross-sectional analysis, 3D X-ray of the interconnect, and electrical testing. Selective cross-sectional analysis was used to study the geometry of the micro-bumps after the chip join, and it was confirmed that micro-bumps were joined without defects, even at different pitches within the same die. The underfill process was also optimized to reinforce the package and reduce the overall stress resulting from the substrate warpage and CTE mismatch. Reliability stressing revealed three fail modes associated with these high-density organic substrates. A complementary non-linear finite element analysis is performed to further characterize and design the allowable critical via configurations of the high-density substrate and of the critical solder joints subjected to aggressive thermal cycling tests. New substrate design groundrules are proposed to meet JEDEC reliability requirements that can enable AI hardware using high density organic substrates.},

  abstract={Companies are facing important challenges related to markets' internationalization, regulatory restrictions and fierce competition especially during the COVID19 crisis. They should embrace change and be agile in order to prevent risks and seize opportunities quickly and efficiently. In this article, we examine how artificial intelligence (AI) can help companies to enhance their organizational agility. Based on two systematic literature reviews on the subject, we identified the weaknesses on relying only on a digital enabler or human resource (HR) practices. Thus, we propose a Framework integrating artificial intelligence and human practices in order to help companies in their efforts towards agility. This latter allows companies to adapt to new regulations in the society, to customers' expectations and to environmental changes. Ultimately, agile companies can ensure a sustainable performance.},
