	abstract = {The objective of this study is to determine the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of firms as a proxy of their financial and economic margins by improving revenues and minimizing expenses. This impact is positive on the market value and scalability by improving the economic and financial sustainability of companies. The methodology is based on a business plan that considers the savings obtained by a traditional firm implementing AI. Specifically, a sensitivity analysis will demonstrate that AI savings impact key parameters, leading to economic and financial sustainability. Additionally, a mathematical interpretation, based on network theory, will be produced to provide and compare the added value of two ecosystems (without and with AI that adds up new nodes and strengthens the existing ones). The main contribution of this paper is the combination of two unrelated approaches, showing the potential of AI in scalable ecosystems. In future research, this innovative methodology could be extended to other technological applications.},

	abstract = {In the artificial intelligence (AI) environment, there is limited research on employees’ perception of career achievement. Previous literature has presented two different viewpoints: AI either reduces or increases employees’ perception of career achievement. We introduce the concept of the intelligent service strategy to resolve this contradiction and explore its underlying reasons. Through three experiments involving 736 front-line employees (with valid responses of 223, 232, and 281 for each study, respectively), this research reveals the influence of organizational intelligent service strategy (substitution vs. collaboration) on employees’ perception of career achievement. To elucidate, compared with the intelligence collaboration service strategy, the intelligence substitution service strategy decreases human–human interactivity and enhances human–machine interactivity, thus reducing employees’ perception of career achievement. Intriguingly, the organizational innovation climate significantly moderates the relationship between (human–human and human–machine) interactivity and employees’ perception of career achievement. Specifically, the organizational innovation climate might mitigate the positive effect of human-human interactivity and the negative effect of human-machine interactivity on the perception of career achievement. This research provides a finer-grained understanding of how employees perceive career achievement when working with AI, thus explaining conflicting conclusions drawn in previous studies. These insights contribute innovatively to the theoretical framework concerning employees’ intrinsic motivations within the intelligent service environment.},

This study employed a multivariable linear regression model to analyze the impact of AI technology on the variation in employee responsibility. We also utilized multiple methods, such as propensity score matching and alternative indicator analysis, to ensure the robustness of the research results. We theorized and found that the application of AI technology has a negative effect on employee responsibility, with supervision cost partially mediating the relationship between AI technology application and employee responsibility. Moreover, the negative relationship between AI technology application and employee responsibility decreases as the level of product market competition in which the firm operates increases, and it is stronger in government-controlled firms than in privately controlled firms. We also found that AI technology application and employee responsibility can improve firm productivity, and employee responsibility has a significant positive impact on innovation output and innovation efficiency, while the application of AI technology does not significantly impact innovation output and innovation efficiency. Our study contributes to research on the impact of AI technology in the workplace and has important implications for organizational practices regarding the application of AI technology and employee responsibility.},

	abstract = {In an era marked by rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), the dynamics of the labour market are undergoing significant transformation. A common concern amidst these changes is the potential obsolescence of traditional disciplines due to AI-driven productivity enhancements. This study delves into the evolving role and resilience of these disciplines within the AI-influenced labour market. Focusing on statistics as a representative field, we investigate its integration with AI and its interplay with other disciplines. Analyzing 279.87 million online job postings in the United States from 2010 to 2022, we observed a remarkable 31-fold increase in the demand for AI-specialized statistical talent, diversifying into 932 distinct AI-related job roles. Additionally, our research identified four major interdisciplinary clusters, encompassing 190 disciplines with a statistical focus. The findings also highlight a growing emphasis on specific hard skills within these AI roles and the differences in demand for AI talent in statistics across economic sectors and regions. Contrary to the pessimistic view of traditional disciplines’ survival in the AI age, our study suggests a more optimistic outlook. We recommend that professionals and organizations proactively adapt to AI advancements. Governments and academic institutions should collaborate to foster interdisciplinary skill development and evaluation for AI talents, thereby enhancing the employability of individuals from traditional disciplines and contributing to broader economic growth.},

	abstract = {The improvement of enterprise ESG performance is one of the key driving forces to achieve the goal of economic and social green development. There is a gap between knowledge and practice in the ESG performance of Chinese enterprises, and digital transformation (DT) provides new ideas for ESG development. The research purpose of this paper is to explore the impact mechanism of DT on ESG and the specific path of DT to drive ESG. It provides a reference for listed enterprises to rely on DT to empower their sustainable development capability. This paper takes the panel data of A-share listed enterprises from 2011 to 2021 as the sample and measures the core indicators using the text mining method, modified Jones model, and Roy-Chowdhury model. On this basis, using a combination of econometric models and qualitative comparative analysis, we empirically analyze the impact mechanisms of DT on ESG as well as the specific grouping paths that drive ESG performance. The main conclusions are shown as follows. First, DT can significantly reduce ESG, with an impact coefficient of − 0.013, which is significant at the 5\% level. It reflects that the DT of enterprises at this stage has certain deficiencies. There is a matching lag in the enterprise's internal organizational resources. The entry of digital technology will have a certain impact on traditional operations, and the high uncertainty of DT adds some hidden costs to the enterprise. Secondly, there is an indirect suppression effect of accrued earnings management (AEM) in the transmission mechanism of DT affecting ESG. It is verified that DT can reduce information asymmetry and inhibit EM activities, thus reducing the impact on ESG. Finally, a total of six configurations achieved high ESG valuations. High technology practice-low performance manipulation; digital intelligence-low performance manipulation; digital intelligence-digital resources; digital resources-inadequate digital infrastructure.; high technology practice-bottom technology deficiency; digital intelligence-high performance manipulation. Through configuration analysis, the suppression effect of EM is further verified. The lack of AEM is usually the core condition of the high-valuation group. Meanwhile, digital intelligence, digital resources, and digital technology practice can drive the improvement of enterprise ESG. The instrumental variables approach and robustness tests support these findings.},

	abstract = {With the acceleration of China’s economic integration process, enterprises have gained greater advantages in the fierce market competition, and gradually formed the trend of grouping and large-scale. However, as the scale of the company increases, the establishment of a branch also causes many problems. For example, in order to obtain more benefits, the business performance of the company can generate false growth, resulting in financial and operational risks. This paper analyzed the current situation and needs of enterprise financial control from two aspects of theory and practice, combined with specific engineering projects, taking ZH Group as an example, according to the actual situation of the enterprise. The article first introduces the basic situation of the enterprise; Then, the financial control strategy was designed, and different modules were designed to achieve financial control; Afterwards, use a reverse neural network to evaluate the effectiveness of financial management and risk warning; Relying on particle swarm optimization algorithm to seek the optimal solution and applying it to financial management and risk warning, in order to improve the level of introspection and risk management in decision-making. Finally, the value of computer intelligence algorithms in financial big data management is evaluated by constructing a financial risk indicator system. Through the analysis of enterprise financial management, the total asset turnover rate of ZH Group decreased by 0.39 times in 5 years. After 5 years of adjustment of the company’s business, the company’s overall operational capabilities still needed to be improved, and the company’s comprehensive business capabilities also still needed to be improved. Therefore, the application of intelligent algorithms for financial control is very necessary.},

	abstract = {In the current global context of environmental degradation and resource constraints, the pursuit of sustainable development has become an imperative. One avenue that holds promise for achieving this objective is the application of digital technologies, which have the potential to decouple economic growth from its carbon footprint. However, it is crucial to ensure that these technologies are designed and governed in a prudent manner, with a strong alignment to environmental priorities. This study focuses on exploring the potential roles of blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) in supply chain coordination and impact mitigation. Furthermore, they have the capacity to incentivize recycling and circular business models, as well as facilitate carbon accounting and offsetting. To fully realize these benefits, it is essential to deploy these technologies within inclusive collaborative frameworks that take into consideration social and ecological considerations. The study also offers policy recommendations that highlight key leverage points for digital innovation, enabling countries to embark on smart and green industrial transformation pathways. By harnessing the potential of blockchain and AI in supply chains, governments can promote transparency, traceability, and accountability, thereby fostering sustainable practices and reducing environmental impacts. Incorporating blockchain and AI technologies into supply chain approaches leads to a substantial improvement in efficiency, as demonstrated by a numerical analysis. In conclusion, the integration of innovative digital technologies offers significant opportunities to optimize production systems and economic activity while prioritizing sustainability objectives for the betterment of society and the environment. These technologies have the potential to mitigate environmental externalities by addressing information imbalances within global supply chains. However, it is essential to prioritize inclusive governance that emphasizes democratic participation to mitigate any unintended negative consequences, especially for vulnerable communities. By ensuring inclusive decision-making processes, we can maximize the positive impact of these technologies while minimizing potential harm.},

	abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has been proven to be a disruptive financial technology in the context of mobile banking that can provide more practical value to users and banks. AI is a critical way of facilitating user acceptance and adoption of mobile banking applications (apps). Nevertheless, the ways in which AI features influence users’ continuance intention towards AI-enabled mobile banking apps have not been investigated from the perspective of an expectation confirmation model (ECM). To address this research gap, this paper develops a research model by combining two constructs pertaining to AI characteristics, namely, perceived intelligence and perceived anthropomorphism, and by using the ECM to explore users’ continuance intentions in this context. We employed a survey research method using a random sampling approach to collect 365 valid responses. A partial least squares approach was used to examine the model. The results show that both intelligence and anthropomorphism can increase user satisfaction via confirmation and perceived usefulness, which in turn fosters users’ willingness to continue to engage in mobile banking. This paper offers theoretical advancements, discusses future directions for mobile banking research and provides practical guidance to app developers with respect to designing and developing proper mobile banking apps using AI technology.},

	abstract = {High levels of confusion persist around the term “algorithm” in general; and in addition to this, there is also conceptual confusion around the application of algorithms to human resource management (HRM) strategy and functions. Although there are several systematic reviews of various algorithmic applications to HRM and many of its functions, no comprehensive evolutionary map of the emergent field of algorithmic HRM (AHRM) could be found in the academic literature. This study has dual aims. The first is to provide conceptual clarity for the field of AHRM, and the second is to map the evolution of AHRM from 2000 to 2022. To address the first aim, we conduct a multidisciplinary synthesis of the concepts related to algorithms which results in a General Framework for Algorithmic Decision-Making. This framework then informs the empirical part of the study which addresses the second aim. A science mapping review is employed to chart and assess the extant literature on algorithmic HRM from 2000 to 2022. This study presents a General Framework for Algorithmic Decision-Making across all business functions and then a Framework for Algorithmic AHRM Tools. This provides conceptual clarity and distinguishes between automated and augmented HR decision-making. Findings also reveal the multidisciplinary nature of this emergent field of inquiry and point to current research, which focuses on specialized applications for HR functions such as workforce planning, learning and development, allocation and scheduling, and recruitment; but lacks emphasis on more integrative strategic HRM contexts. The study also has implications for organizational strategic decision-making. HR practitioners may need to form project teams with their information technology (IT) and data analyst colleagues when making strategic decisions about algorithmic applications for HR strategy and HR functions. This also lends itself to future research with multidisciplinary research teams including HR researchers along with computer scientists, computational engineers, and data analysts.},

Intelligence can reduce material waste and pollutant emissions by improving the engineering environmental monitoring capability and the refinement of engineering resource control, thus improving the environmental friendliness of the project. The research in this paper helps to promote the integrated development of intelligent and green power engineering, to better achieve economic and green goals.},

	abstract = {The digital transformation of firms is a pervasive trend within the digital-based economy. Despite its inevitability, there is a continuing debate regarding the most effective methods for implementing such transformations. This study delineates four digital technology strategies—searching, enhancing, grafting, and integrating—within the theoretical framework that digital technology can strengthen an enterprise’s existing legacy technology. Using fuzzy qualitative comparative analysis, this study examines 76 Chinese high-tech manufacturing companies to uncover the configuration effects of technology distance, the type of technical search, and leadership perceptions on the adoption of these strategies. The empirical results reveal that the searching strategy is commonly employed in scenarios involving general technology, search breadth, and the perceived usefulness of the technology. The enhancing strategy is typically adopted when companies engage in extensive searches and perceive digital technology as easy to use. Moreover, the grafting strategy has emerged as the natural choice when there is a deep search for specific technologies coupled with a recognition of their usefulness. The integrating strategy becomes prominent when a company identifies a specific technology through both search breadth and search depth, acknowledging its usefulness and ease of use simultaneously. These findings offer valuable insights for managers aiming to select an effective digital technology strategy to facilitate successful transformation.},

This paper explores how the introduction of industrial robots has changed air quality at both the local and neighborhood levels in China. Using the Spatial Durbin Model, we investigate the regional spillovers of PM 2.5 concentration and the diffusion of this innovative technology. Our findings reveal that the rise of robots significantly reduces air pollution in the local area, while exacerbating it in neighboring regions. This contrast is mainly because pollution-intensive industries are more inclined to relocate to neighboring regions than their cleaner counterparts, after the local use of robots increases. Throughout the process, internal costs rather than external costs dominate firms’ relocation decisions. This study provides novel insights into the complex environmental externalities associated with the spread of industrial robots and highlights the critical issue of growing environmental inequality in the era of emerging technologies.},

	abstract = {The application of intelligent technology, such as industrial robots, is related to the environmental governance effectiveness of enterprises and the realization of the goal of “carbon peak and carbon neutrality”. Due to their similar external environments, driven by economic rationality, peer enterprises will mimic the robotics applications of other enterprises, which in turn will affect the enterprises' carbon emissions. However, little literature has explored the impact of industrial robot application on enterprise carbon emissions from the perspective of peer effect. Based on the data of Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share manufacturing listed enterprises in China from 2011 to 2021, this paper explores the impact of industrial robot application on carbon emission reduction of manufacturing enterprises from the perspective of peer effect. It is found that the industry peer effect and regional peer effect brought by the application of industrial robots are conducive to promoting the carbon emission reduction of enterprises. Among them, the industry peer effect of industrial robot applications promotes carbon emission reduction by enhancing the green innovation ability of enterprises, while the regional peer effect promotes carbon emission reduction by improving the service level of enterprises. It is further found that the degree of industry competition and the level of environmental regulation have inverted U-shaped moderating effects on the industrial robot application industry peer effect, regional peer effect, and enterprises' carbon emission reduction, respectively. The results enrich the research on the impact of industrial robot application on carbon emission reduction of manufacturing enterprises and provide policy implications for improving the environmental performance of enterprises.},

	abstract = {With advanced science and digital technology, digital transformation has become an important way to promote the sustainable development of enterprises. However, the existing research only focuses on the linear relationship between a single characteristic and digital transformation. In this study, we select the data of Chinese A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2020, innovatively use the machine learning method and explore the differences in the predictive effects of multi-dimensional features on the digital transformation of enterprises based on the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) theory, thus identifying the main drivers affecting digital transformation and the fitting models with stronger predictive effect. The study found that: first, by comparing machine learning and traditional linear regression models, it is found that the prediction ability of ensemble earning method is generally higher than that of tradition measurement method. For the sample data selected in this research, XGBoost and LightGBM have strong explanatory ability and high prediction accuracy. Second, compared with the technical driving force and environmental driving force, the organizational driving force has a greater impact. Third, among these characteristics, equity concentration and executives’ knowledge level in organizational dimension have the greatest impact on digital transformation. Therefore, enterprise managers should always pay attention to the decision-making role of equity concentration and executives’ knowledge level. This study further enriches the literature on digital transformation in enterprises, expands the application of machine learning in economics, and provides a theoretical basis for enterprises to enhance digital transformation.},

Addressing this issue, this study presents a literature review on financial fraud detection through machine learning techniques. The PRISMA and Kitchenham methods were applied, and 104 articles published between 2012 and 2023 were examined. These articles were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria and were obtained from databases such as Scopus, IEEE Xplore, Taylor \&amp; Francis, SAGE, and ScienceDirect. These selected articles, along with the contributions of authors, sources, countries, trends, and datasets used in the experiments, were used to detect financial fraud and its existing types. Machine learning models and metrics were used to assess performance. The analysis indicated a trend toward using real datasets. Notably, credit card fraud detection models are the most widely used for detecting credit card loan fraud. The information obtained by different authors was acquired from the stock exchanges of China, Canada, the United States, Taiwan, and Tehran, among other countries. Furthermore, the usage of synthetic data has been low (less than 7\% of the employed datasets). Among the leading contributors to the studies, China, India, Saudi Arabia, and Canada remain prominent, whereas Latin American countries have few related publications.},

In this way, it is able to become a scarce resource and an economic asset by encapsulating the market value of a piece of digital art, which may or may not have a reference in the real world. This study will delve into the ethical aspects underlying what is known as the NFT Revolution, particularly impacts related to the abuse or destruction of cultural heritage, speculation and the generation of economic bubbles and environmental unsustainability.

	abstract = {Enterprise risk management (ERM) frameworks convey vital principles that help create a consistent risk management culture, irrespective of employee turnover or industry standards. Enterprise Management System (EMS) are becoming a popular research area for assuring a company’s long-term success. Statistical pattern recognition, federated learning, database administration, visualization technology, and social networking are all used in this field, which includes artificial intelligence (AI), data science, and statistics. Risk assessment in EMS is critical for enterprise decision-making to be effective. Recent advancements in AI, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) concepts have enabled the development of effective risk assessment models for EMS. This special issue seeks groundbreaking research articles that showcase the application of applied probability and statistics to interdisciplinary studies. This study offers Improved Metaheuristics with a Deep Learning Enabled Risk Assessment Model (IMDLRA-SES) for Smart Enterprise Systems. Using feature selection (FS) and DL models, the provided IMDLRA-SES technique estimates business risks. Preprocessing is used in the IMDLRA-SES technique to change the original financial data into a usable format. In addition, an FS technique based on oppositional lion swarm optimization (OLSO) is utilized to find the best subset of features. In addition, the presence or absence of financial hazards in firms is classified using the triple tree seed algorithm (TTSA) with a probabilistic neural network (PNN) model. The TTSA is used as a hyperparameter optimizer to improve the efficiency of the PNN-based categorization. An extensive set of experimental evaluations is performed on German and Australian credit datasets to illustrate the IMDLRA-SES model’s improved performance. The performance validation of the IMDLRA-SES model portrayed a superior accuracy value of 95.70\% and 96.09\% over existing techniques.},

	abstract = {This article focuses on the structural aspects of the development of ethical software, and argues that ethical considerations need to be embedded into the (agile) software development process. In fact, it is claimed that agile processes of software development lend themselves specifically well for this endeavor. First, it is contended that ethical evaluations need to go beyond the use of software products and include an evaluation of the software itself. This implies that software engineers influence peoples’ lives through the features of their designed products. Embedded values should thus also be approached by software engineers themselves. Therefore, the emphasis is put on the possibility to implement ethical deliberations in already existing and well-established agile software development processes. The proposed approach relies on software engineers making their own judgments throughout the entire development process to ensure that technical features and ethical evaluation can be addressed adequately to transport and foster desirable values and norms. It is argued that agile software development processes may help the implementation of ethical deliberation for five reasons: (1) agile methods are widely spread, (2) their emphasis on flat hierarchies promotes independent thinking and autonomy, (3) their reliance on existing team structures serve as an incubator for deliberation, (4) agile development enhances object-focused techno-ethical realism, and, finally, (5) agile structures provide a salient endpoint to deliberation.},
